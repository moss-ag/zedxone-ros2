# ZED X One - ROS 2

This repository provides ROS 2 components to use the ZED X One with ROS 2 as a monocular color camera.

## Stereo configuration

The [ZED ROS 2 Wrapper](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper/) around the ZED SDK allows you to use a virtual Stereo Camera composed of two ZED X One devices with a custom baseline.
